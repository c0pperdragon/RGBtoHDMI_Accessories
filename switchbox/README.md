# Switchbox

Mechanical switchbox to select one of two 6-pin inputs to be forwarded to one Analog RGBtoHDMI.

Note that only the 3 color signals and the csync is switched. The GND and +5V pins are always 
connected through. Therefore do not connect two cables that provide their +5V to the RGBtoHDMI 
at the same time, as these would then be shorted together, which could damage either or 
both of the connected machines.
